# ML Notes

#### Bias-variance trade-off

Bias: error between average model prediction and ground truth

Variance: error from sensitivity to small fluctuations

Low model complexity, high bias, low variance, underfitting

High model complexiy, low bias, high variance, overfitting

Model error = bias^2 + variance + random error


#### Cross-validation

Avoid over-fitting

Model use k-1 fold for training, validate on remaining fold


#### Parametric model

Parametric model: number of paramaters is fixed

Non-parametric model: number of parameters can grow


#### Regression


#### SVM

Support Vector Machine: find out a plane that differentiate two categories

Usually used for classification problem

Maximize margin

Transform data into linear


#### Decision tree
