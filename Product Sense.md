### [High acquisition but low retention, what do you do?](https://stellarpeers.com/cases/high-acquisition-but-low-retention-what-do-you-do/)

You launched a new web application signup flow to encourage new users to add more profile information. A/B test results indicate that the number of people that added additional profile information increased by 8%. However, 7-day retention decreased by 20%. What do you do?

Retention: number of logged in sessions per week

Signups: once the user has answered all the required questions, we count that as a sign-up

- Sign-up process has too many questions, user drops off: users finish answering the required questions but drop off when answering the optional questions, check when users drop off

- User is put off by questions that ask for private information: identify these questions, inform users

- Lousy first experience after signup, ends with cliffhanger: find out what the next step is after sign-up 

- Bugs or poor UI design: offer an easy way to give feedback

## Root cause analysis

### [Uber cancellations have gone up, what happened?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHXXW1mnAio)

**Clarify questions: share thinking behind questions**

1. Define metric 

Driver vs *rider* cancellation

Number of cancellation vs *cancellation %*

2. Time period

Steady decline

*Sudden decline: over last 2 weeks*

Similar pattern before

3. Change % vs benchmark

What % of change have gone up by? *5% doubled to 10%*

4. Specific issue vs *explore*

**Identify levers: summarize info so far that help you hypothesize**

1. Users 

2. User flow

3. Segmentation: region, days *no segmentation*

**Hypothesize and validate: make hypothesis specific to question**

1. Destination error

Validate: 

Check data: how many of the cancellation lead to a reorder with new address

User research

In product surveys: ask why did you cancel

2. Pricing: compare with Lyft

3. Ride being processed

Check average processing time and compare with two weeks ago

Check number of active drivers and number of active orders

4. Eta too long

**Prioritize**

Criteria: 

- Likely to contribute to 10% increase

- Easy to validate / invalidate

*Pricing, wait time*

**Fix

1. Cheaper pricing and emphasize better features

2. Increase incentives to increase driver supply, notify inactive drivers to come back, relax algorithm

Political: tax policy, trade restrictions

Economic: economic growth rate, interest rate, inflation, unemployment rate

Social: cultural, health, population growth, age distribution

Technological: R&D activity, technological incentives

Environmental: weather conditions, temperature, climate change, pollution, natural disaster

Legal: industry regulation, licenses, intellectual property

### M: market, Porter’s five forces

Competition in the industry: fewer competitors, greater power to charge higher price and deals

Potential of new entrants into the industry: lower barriers to entry, more competitiors

Power of suppliers: fewer suppliers, more rely on suppliers

Power of customers: small and more powerful customers, less ability to negotiate deals

Threat of substitute products: no close substitute, more power to increase price

### Profit: revenue - cost

Revenue = price * volumn

Cost = fixed cost + variable cost
