### [What goal would you set for Airbnb？](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHJYtNLh4Vo) 

**Product, users, value**

Successful when people make booking

Guests: have a place to stay

Hosts: earn money from lenting

Platform: earn commission from booking cost

**Northstar metric**

Northstar metric: the one metric that captures the core value that your product delivers to customers

Total number of nights booked

**Breakdown northstar**

Total number of nights booked: total number of active guests * number of nights booked per guest

Number of nights booked per guest: number of active listings, views of listsing, confirmed bookings - cancelled bookings

Number of active listings: number of active hosts * listings per hosts

Number of active hosts: new + exitsing + return - left

Healthy ecosystem: 

- Supply > demand by X:Y ratio

- Quality of supply

- Demand growth via word of mouth

**Tradeoff, countermetric**

Tradeoff: hosts with 1 or few listsing vs commercial hosts with multiple listsings

Countermetrics: 

- number of listings with <4 stars --> to maintain high quality

- number of listsing reported

## Root cause analysis

### [Uber cancellations have gone up, what happened?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHXXW1mnAio)

**Clarify questions: share thinking behind questions**

1. Define metric 

Driver vs *rider* cancellation

Number of cancellation vs *cancellation %*

2. Time period

Steady decline

*Sudden decline: over last 2 weeks*

Similar pattern before

3. Change % vs benchmark

What % of change have gone up by? *5% doubled to 10%*

4. Specific issue vs *explore*

**Identify levers: summarize info so far that help you hypothesize**

1. Users 

2. User flow

3. Segmentation: region, days *no segmentation*

**Hypothesize and validate: make hypothesis specific to question**

1. Destination error

Validate: 

Check data: how many of the cancellation lead to a reorder with new address

User research

In product surveys: ask why did you cancel

2. Pricing: compare with Lyft

3. Ride being processed

Check average processing time and compare with two weeks ago

Check number of active drivers and number of active orders

4. Eta too long

**Prioritize**

Criteria: 

- Likely to contribute to 10% increase

- Easy to validate / invalidate

*Pricing, wait time*

**Fix

1. Cheaper pricing and emphasize better features

2. Increase incentives to increase driver supply, notify inactive drivers to come back, relax algorithm
