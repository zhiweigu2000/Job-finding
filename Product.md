Uber cancellations have gone up, what happened?

### Clarify questions: share thinking behind questions

1. Define metric 

Driver vs **rider** cancellation

Number of cancellation vs **cancellation %**

2. Time period

Steady decline

**Sudden decline: over last 2 weeks**

Similar pattern before

3. Change % vs benchmark

What % of change have gone up by? **5% doubled to 10%**

4. Specific issue vs **explore**

### Identify levers: summarize info so far that help you hypothesize

1. Users 

2. User flow

3. Segmentation: region, days **no segmentation**

### Hypothesize and validate: make hypothesis specific to question

1. Destination error

Validate: 

Check data: how many of the cancellation lead to a reorder with new address

User research

In product surveys: ask why did you cancel

2. Pricing: compare with Lyft

3. Ride being processed

Check average processing time and compare with two weeks ago

Check number of active drivers and number of active orders

4. Eta too long

### Prioritize

Criteria: 

- Likely to contribute to 10% increase

- Easy to validate / invalidate

**Pricing, wait time**

### Fix

1. Cheaper pricing and emphasize better features

2. Increase incentives to increase driver supply, notify inactive drivers to come back, relax algorithm
