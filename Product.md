**What goal would you set for Airbnb**

### Product, users, value

Marketplace: guests and hosts

Successful when they make booking

Guests: place to stay

Hosts: earn money from lenting

Platform: earn commission from booking cost

### Northstar metric

Total number of nights booked

### Breakdown northstar

Total number of nights booked: total number of active guests * number of nights booked per guest

Number of nights booked per guest: number of active listings, views of listsing, confirmed bookings - cancelled bookings

Number of active listsings: number of active hosts * listings per hosts

Number of active listsings: new + exitsing + resurrected - left

Healthy ecosystem: 

- Supply > demand by X:Y ratio

- Quality of supply

- Demand growth via word of mouth

### Tradeoff, countermetric

Tradeoff: hosts with 1 or few listsing vs commercial hosts with multiple listsings

Countermetric:

- number of listings with <4 stars, maintain high quality

- number of listsing reported

**Youtube adds in the beginning or middle?**

### Product & value

Creators: share content with people, monetize if more than 1000 subscribers

Watchers: diverse content, easy to search, personalized

### Key metrics

Total watch time per day

Number of videos watched per day

Average percentage of videos watched

Number of ad impression

Ad clicks

### Hypothesis

Beginning: 

- Get more ad impression 

- Do not watch the video (annoyed, ad leads people to another page)

- Less watch rate, discourage creators, less profit for platform

- People not engage with ad

Middle:

- Decrease ad impression

- Higher ad engagement

- Increase total watch time

### A/B test

First group: beginning

Second group: middle

Third group: before most people left (somewhere before middle)

Hold everything else the same

Metrics: 

- Ad impressions

- Ad clicks

- Percentage of ad watched 

- Total watch time

- Total number of videos watched

### Data driven decision

Total volumn of ad clicks go up

Total watch time

## Root cause analysis

**Uber cancellations have gone up, what happened?**

### Clarify questions: share thinking behind questions

1. Define metric 

Driver vs **rider** cancellation

Number of cancellation vs **cancellation %**

2. Time period

Steady decline

**Sudden decline: over last 2 weeks**

Similar pattern before

3. Change % vs benchmark

What % of change have gone up by? **5% doubled to 10%**

4. Specific issue vs **explore**

### Identify levers: summarize info so far that help you hypothesize

1. Users 

2. User flow

3. Segmentation: region, days **no segmentation**

### Hypothesize and validate: make hypothesis specific to question

1. Destination error

Validate: 

Check data: how many of the cancellation lead to a reorder with new address

User research

In product surveys: ask why did you cancel

2. Pricing: compare with Lyft

3. Ride being processed

Check average processing time and compare with two weeks ago

Check number of active drivers and number of active orders

4. Eta too long

### Prioritize

Criteria: 

- Likely to contribute to 10% increase

- Easy to validate / invalidate

**Pricing, wait time**

### Fix

1. Cheaper pricing and emphasize better features

2. Increase incentives to increase driver supply, notify inactive drivers to come back, relax algorithm
